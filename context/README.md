# KUL-Hackaton2026
Duolingo is a large-scale online language learning platform that provides interactive exercises to millions of users worldwide. Because of its scale and controlled learning environment, Duolingo has become a valuable source of behavioral and linguistic data for research in machine learning, natural language processing, and educational data mining. Through Duolingo Research (https://research.duolingo.com/), several datasets have been released to support reproducible research in areas such as notification optimization, translation modeling, and spaced repetition.

Datasets for the Datathon:

- 1. 2020 Notification Bandit Data
  User-level logs of push notifications over ~35 days.
  Each row records the notification timestamp, user interface language, a list of eligible templates, historical performance of each template for that user, the template actually sent, and whether the user completed a lesson within 2 hours.

- 2.  2020 STAPLE Shared Task Data
  Data originates from Duolingo translation exercises, where learners submitted many valid translations for the same English prompt.
  Covers five language pairs: English → Portuguese, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.

- 3. Spaced Repetition Data
  The dataset was released together with Duolingo’s Half-Life Regression (HLR) model to support research on computational modeling of human memory and personalized review scheduling.
  It contains approximately 13 million anonymized records of user–word (lexeme) interactions across multiple target languages and diverse learner backgrounds.
